How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the datadir needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended
to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.

From Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.10 are no
longer supported, as Bitcoin Core is now built using Qt 5.9.x which requires
macOS 10.10+. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.

In addition to previously supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled
distribution provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.
